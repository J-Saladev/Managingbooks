Hello!

This is a book manager, the books are stored locally on your system using data.json,
the uploaded pictures are also saved onto the application. I took a lot of care into making 
everything look nicely. For each book you add a nice card with all the info will be added, and
you will be able to open a page for each book that will render dynamically.

This was one of my first experiences with express
